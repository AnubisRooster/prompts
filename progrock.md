Progressive, atmospheric metal in the style of Tool with polyrhythmic drums,
circular bass riffs, shadowy guitar harmonics, and slow-building intensity.
Mood: mystical, introspective, ritualistic, and ultimately triumphant. The theme
is resurrection — not literal zombie imagery, but spiritual rebirth, awakening,
and rising through inner darkness into clarity. Production should feel spacious
with long delays, thick bass presence, and evolving rhythmic layers.

Instrumentation: tribal tom-heavy drumming, subtle odd-time (5/4, 7/8) patterns,
droning bass pedal tones, clean-to-distorted guitar swells, and whispered-to-soaring
vocals with stacked harmonies in the climax.

Vocal style: dark, meditative spoken lines that evolve into melodic, emotionally
charged singing. Occasional whispered doubles. Delivery should feel like a ritual
chant becoming a revelation.

Structure:
Extended Intro → Verse 1 → Pre-Chorus → Chorus → Verse 2 →

[LYRICS]

(Extended Intro – instrumental only)

[Verse 1]
I felt the weight of the world in my marrow,
Hands pressed down by a thousand yesterdays.
Silence carved a circle in my shadow,
Lost between the echo and the haze.

[Pre-Chorus]
But something moved beneath the ashes,
A pulse I thought I'd buried deep.
A quiet tremor shaking through the fractures,
A spark awakening from sleep.

[Chorus]
Lift me from the hollow I’ve been living in.
Break the shell I forged to keep the darkness in.
Through the veil, I breathe again—returning.
From the dust, I rise—resurrected, burning.

[Verse 2]
I walked the labyrinth built from my failures,
Every step a stone upon my chest.
But through the cracks, a golden thread grew bolder,
Pulling me toward a higher crest.

[Instrumental Build]
(Heavy toms, rising bass drone, guitar harmonics swelling)

[Final Chorus – Expanded]
Lift me from the hollow I’ve been living in.
Break the shell I forged to keep the darkness in.
Through the veil, I breathe again—returning.
From the dust, I rise—resurrected, burning.
I’m not who I was when the night first took me in—
I return in light, awake beneath my skin.

End.
