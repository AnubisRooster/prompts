[LYRICS]

[Intro – Harmonized Chant]
Risin’ from the shadow, walkin’ through the flame again. (11 syllables)
Breathin’ in the light now, feel it in my veins again. (12)

[Verse 1 – Double-Time Flow]
Came up out the darkness, heavy on my spirit but I kept on movin’. (15)
Battlin’ the burden of the past but the vision had me pushin’ through it. (16)
Every single setback, every single breakdown turned into a sign. (14)
Now I’m in the fast lane, reborn in the rhythm, elevated mind. (14)

Liftin’ off the ashes, steady with the passion when I realign. (14)
See me in the sunlight, breakin’ every limit that was in my mind. (15)
Walkin’ with the fire, higher than the fear that tried to drag me low. (15)
Resurrection in my chest, feel the energy and let it grow. (14)

[Hook – Melodic + Harmonies]
Rise up, rise up, break the chains that kept me frozen in the night. (15)
Shine up, shine up, feel the spark awaken, turn it into light. (15)
I breathe, I rise, I live again, I see the truth that’s deep within. (15)
Reborn, revived, the darkness fades, I’m steppin’ through a brand-new wind. (15)

[Verse 2 – Faster & More Intense]
Steady with the motion, never losin’ focus when the pressure hittin’. (14)
Spirit in the center like a beacon in the storm and I refuse to quit it. (16)
Grew from the pain, made waves in the rain ’til the path turned bright. (15)
Now I’m elevated, navigated every shadow till I found new sight. (16)

Truth in the rhythm and the rhythm is a vision of the life I claim. (15)
Watch me resurrect every doubt that I burned in the cleansing flame. (15)
Walkin’ with the gift that the struggle and the battle had to help me find. (16)
Now I’m on the rise with a purified soul and a sharpened mind. (16)

[Final Hook – Expanded]
Rise up, rise up, break the chains that kept me frozen in the night. (15)
Shine up, shine up, feel the spark awaken, turn it into light. (15)
I breathe, I rise, I live again, I see the truth that’s deep within. (15)
Reborn, revived, the darkness fades, I’m steppin’ through a brand-new wind. (15)
Never fallin’ back, I’m awakened — resurrected from the place I’ve been. (16)

#Double-time version
Create extremely fast, triple-time melodic hip-hop with explosive delivery,
stacked harmonies, sharp rhythmic triplets, and clear vowel-forward phrasing.
The sound should feel urgent, high-energy, and intensely uplifting. Theme:
resurrection and ascension — blasting out of darkness with speed, fire, and
renewed purpose.

Production style: deep punchy kick, tight snare, rolling hi-hats in dense
patterns, gritty low-end, airy pads, and bright chant-like harmonies. The flow
should stay locked into triple-time phrasing with rapid internal rhymes, quick
percussive consonants, and smooth open-vowel endings.

Vocal style: fast melodic rap with explosive bursts, layered harmonies on key
phrases, aggressive ad-libs, and precise rhythmic emphasis. Maintain clarity
even at very high speed. Keep lines short, punchy, and rhythmically elastic.

Structure:
Intro (fast chant) → Verse 1 (triple-time blast) → Hook (melodic explosion) →
Verse 2 (even faster) → Final Hook (expanded)

Use the exact lyrics below:

[LYRICS]

[Intro – Rapid Chant]
Wake up, break out, flame in my soul.  
Run through the dark, reclaiming control.  

--------------------------------
VERSE 1 — Triple-Time Blast
--------------------------------

Shot from the shadow, I’m breakin’ the chains.  
Light in my chest and it’s runnin’ my veins.  
Fire beneath me, I’m shiftin’ the planes.  
Rise from the night and I’m shedding the stains.  

Pulse in the rhythm, I’m cuttin’ the noise.  
Spirit ascending, I’m liftin’ my voice.  
Breaking the limits, I’m makin’ the choice.  
Runnin’ the path with a radiant poise.  

--------------------------------
HOOK — Melodic Explosion
--------------------------------

Lift me higher — tearing through the silence like a flame.  
Break the barrier — nothing in the shadows stays the same.  
Feel the energy — rising from the ground without the shame.  
I return renewed — stepping from the storm I overcame.  

--------------------------------
VERSE 2 — Even Faster
--------------------------------

Breath in the thunder, I’m pushin’ the speed.  
Light in my heartbeat, I follow the lead.  
Cut through the darkness, I plant a new seed.  
Rise through resistance, I’m breakin’ the bleed.  

Glow in my center, I channel the burn.  
Fast through the spiral, I pivot and turn.  
Everything lost is a lesson I earn.  
Now I’m ascended, I rise and return.  

--------------------------------
FINAL HOOK — Expanded
--------------------------------

Lift me higher — tearing through the silence like a flame.  
Break the barrier — nothing in the shadows stays the same.  
Feel the energy — rising from the ground without the shame.  
I return renewed — stepping from the storm I overcame.  
Burning brighter now — racing into life with no restraint.  

End.
