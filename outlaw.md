Create a gritty outlaw-country song with acoustic and electric guitars, warm low-end,
minimal but driving percussion, and a rebellious, dust-road atmosphere. Tone should
blend defiance, resilience, and hard-won wisdom. Vocal delivery should feel raw,
weathered, and honest. Include imagery of long roads, scars, redemption, and a
sense of pushing against fate.

Structure:
Verse 1 (AABB rhyme)
Chorus 1 (simple, direct)
Verse 2 (AABB rhyme)
Chorus 2 (larger, more intense than the first)
Bridge (reflective)
Final Chorus (fullest, emotionally expanded)

Use the following lyrics exactly:

[LYRICS]

--------------------------------
VERSE 1 (AABB)
--------------------------------
I rode out early with the dust still hangin’ low (A)  
Left that town behind with nothin’ left to show (A)  
I kept my pride tucked deep where no man goes (B)  
Walked the line alone through highs and bitter lows (B)  

--------------------------------
CHORUS 1 — Simple, Direct
--------------------------------
And I keep ridin’, ridin’ through the wind and rain,  
Tryin’ to outrun all this heartache and the pain.  

--------------------------------
VERSE 2 (AABB)
--------------------------------
I crossed those badlands with a fire in my chest (A)  
Faced down the thunder when the night refused to rest (A)  
I shook the ghosts that kept on callin’ out my name (B)  
Burned through the shadows, rose up from the flame (B)  

--------------------------------
CHORUS 2 — Bigger, More Intense
--------------------------------
Still I keep ridin’, ridin’ through the wind and rain,  
Tryin’ to outrun all this heartache and the pain.  
But now I’m standin’, standin’ where the strong remain,  
And every mile I take cuts loose another chain.  

--------------------------------
BRIDGE — Reflective
--------------------------------
I’ve lost more nights than I’ll ever dare to tell,  
But every dawn I rise is proof I walked through hell.  

--------------------------------
FINAL CHORUS — Full, Expansive, Climactic
--------------------------------
So I keep ridin’, ridin’ through the wind and rain,  
Tryin’ to outrun all this heartache and the pain.  
And now I’m shoutin’, shoutin’ like I broke the chain,  
Feelin’ the fire inside me spark again.  
Yeah, I keep pushin’, pushin’ down this outlaw lane,  
’Cause every road I ride leads me to rise again.  

End.
