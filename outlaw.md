Create a gritty outlaw-country song with acoustic and electric guitars, warm low-end,
minimal but driving percussion, and a rebellious, dust-road atmosphere. Tone should
blend defiance, resilience, and hard-won wisdom. Vocal delivery should feel raw,
weathered, and honest. Include imagery of long roads, scars, redemption, and a
sense of pushing against fate.

Structure:
[Verse 1: Raw, steady vocal delivery with sparse acoustic guitar and subtle percussion]
[Chorus 1: Slightly more melodic, harmonized vocals with full acoustic backing]
[Verse 2: Stronger vocal intensity, slightly more rhythmic drive, electric guitar accents]
[Chorus 2: Layered harmonies, fuller instrumentation, rising intensity]
[Bridge: Introspective, emotional phrasing, softer instrumentation for contrast]
[Final Chorus: Full instrumentation, powerful harmonies, emotionally climactic delivery]

Use the following lyrics exactly:

[Verse 1: Raw, steady vocal delivery with sparse acoustic guitar and subtle percussion]
I rode out early with the dust still hangin’ low  
Left that town behind with nothin’ left to show  
I kept my pride tucked deep where no man goes  
Walked the line alone through highs and bitter lows  

[Chorus 1: Slightly more melodic, harmonized vocals with full acoustic backing]
And I keep ridin’, ridin’ through the wind and rain  
Tryin’ to outrun all this heartache and the pain  

[Verse 2: Stronger vocal intensity, slightly more rhythmic drive, electric guitar accents]
I crossed those badlands with a fire in my chest  
Faced down the thunder when the night refused to rest  
I shook the ghosts that kept on callin’ out my name  
Burned through the shadows, rose up from the flame  

[Chorus 2: Layered harmonies, fuller instrumentation, rising intensity]
Still I keep ridin’, ridin’ through the wind and rain  
Tryin’ to outrun all this heartache and the pain  
But now I’m standin’, standin’ where the strong remain  
And every mile I take cuts loose another chain  

[Bridge: Introspective, emotional phrasing, softer instrumentation for contrast]
I’ve lost more nights than I’ll ever dare to tell  
But every dawn I rise is proof I walked through hell  

[Final Chorus: Full instrumentation, powerful harmonies, emotionally climactic delivery]
So I keep ridin’, ridin’ through the wind and rain  
Tryin’ to outrun all this heartache and the pain  
And now I’m shoutin’, shoutin’ like I broke the chain  
Feelin’ the fire inside me spark again  
Yeah, I keep pushin’, pushin’ down this outlaw lane  
’Cause every road I ride leads me to rise again  

End.
